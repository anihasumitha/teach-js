// Question 1
// Write a JavaScript program to construct the following 
// pattern, using a nested for loop.

// * * * * *

// Question 2
// Write a JavaScript program to compute the greatest 
// common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

// Question 3
// Use a while loop to continously play the game until
// the user ends the game.


// Question 4: Guess the Secret Word
// Create a simple text-based word-guessing game in JavaScript. 
// The game should meet the following requirements:

// 1. The player must guess a secret word within a limited
//  number of attempts.
// 2. Use a string to store the secret word.
// 3. Use an array to keep track of the guessed letters.
// 4. Use numbers to track the remaining attempts.

// Logic:
// 5. Use if-else or switch statements to check if a 
// guessed letter is correct, incorrect, or already guessed.

// 6. Use loops (for or while) to iterate through the 
// game process and display the current state of the 
// guessed word.

// Gameplay Rules:
// 7. The game should display the current state of the 
// word after each guess (e.g., "_ _ a _ _" for the word 
// "apple" after guessing "a").

// 8. If the player guesses all the letters in the word 
// before running out of attempts, they win.

// 9. If the player runs out of attempts, the game ends, 
// and the secret word is revealed.

// Question 5: Tic-Tac-Toe

// Two players (Player X and Player O) take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
// The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, 
// or diagonally) wins. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the 
// game ends in a draw.

// Data Structures to Use:
// Use a 2D array to represent the 3x3 grid.
// Use strings ("X" and "O") to represent the players' marks.
// Use a number to track the total number of moves.

// Logic:
// Use if-else or switch statements to validate moves and check for 
// a win or draw.
// Use loops (for or while) to display the board and allow players to take 
// turns making moves.

// Gameplay Rules:
// Players must enter the row and column indices (0, 1, or 2) of their 
// chosen grid space.
// If a player attempts to mark a space that is already occupied or 
// enters an invalid index, they should be prompted to try again.
// After each move, the game should check if the current player has 
// won or if the game has ended in a draw.
