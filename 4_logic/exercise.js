/*
Question 1:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of 
the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, 
print "FizzBuzz".


Question 2:
Write a program that determines if it's a good day for a picnic based on the following conditions:
1. If it's raining, it's not a good day for a picnic.
2. If the temperature is below 10 degrees or above 30 degrees, it's not a good day for a picnic.
3. If the wind speed is above 25 km/h, it's not a good day for a picnic.
4. If the weather condition is "stormy", it's not a good day for a picnic.
5. Otherwise, it's a good day for a picnic.
